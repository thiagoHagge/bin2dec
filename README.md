Bin2Dec is a small project that I did to practice my skills in web development. In this project I worked only with HTML, CSS and JS.
The website has a function to convert binary numbers to decimal numbers and the other way around.


#### Features

* Responsive website (mobile first)
* User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field
* User will be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered
